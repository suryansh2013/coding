    <H1>Hello Everyone!</H1>
    <H2>Today's topic is indroduction about coding</H2>
    <H3> INTRODUCTION</H3>
    <P>Coding, sometimes called computer programming, is how we communicate with computers. Code tells a computer what actions to take, and writing code is like creating a set of instructions. By learning to write code, you can tell computers what to do or how to behave in a much faster way. You can use this skill to make websites and apps, process data, and do lots of other cool things.</P>
    <H3>WHY TO LEARN CODING AND WHAT ARE ITS BENEFITS?</H3>
    <P>We all have hopes, dreams, and plans for the future. Whether you’re looking for a new opportunity, want to optimize your current job, or are simply searching for a new hobby, coding can help you get closer to your goals. And remember, anyone can learn how to code!</P>
    <H3>HOW DOES CODING WORK?</H3>
    <P>Computer programming languages, developed through a series of numerical or alphabetic codes, instruct machines to complete specific actions. Computer coding functions much like a manual.

        A programmer or developer writes instructions describing the information and tasks needed to create a visual or to perform a task. Computers scan extensive coded manuals very quickly, executing the tasks that create and run a successful website or application. Displaying an image or section of text, changing font styles, and opening emails all require instructions included in the coded manual.Users interact with websites and apps with the help of these coded instructions. The code itself does not show up on the screen. Instead, people see the words and images a developer or programmer asks the computer to display.

        Coding tells a machine which actions to perform and how to complete tasks. Programming languages provide the rules for building websites, apps, and other computer-based technologies. Each programming language helps humans accurately communicate with machines.</P>
    <H3>TYPES OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES.</H3>
    <P>Binary code comprises a series of zeros and ones, used to communicate instructions. This code is a low-level programming language. Each digit in a coded sequence connects to a switch in your computer. Each switch connects to an action, and together thousands of switches operate a device.

        High-level code, a computer communication process that works much like human language, allows programmers to operate entire systems simultaneously. High-level programming languages convert human language from programmers into binary code that computers understand.</P>
    <H3>WHAT IS BINARY CODE?</H3>
    <P>This concept of electrical charges and the existence of only two possible states ties in nicely with the numerical system computers use in their hardware. They use it to complete every single task they are given. It's called binary code and is made up of sequences of 0s and 1s.

        Binary code by design corresponds directly with specific machine instructions, commands, and locations in the computer's memory. The computer then reads and interprets these instructions and then carries out particular tasks.
        
        Computers are made up of a combination of thousands of tiny physical devices that act as electrical switches, called transistors.</P>
    <H3>PROGRAM <B>VS</B> CODING</H3>
    <P>Programming means telling a computer what to do and how to do that thing you told it to do.

        It involves providing well thought-out, methodogical instructions for your computer to read and execute.
        
        You have to break down large tasks into smaller ones. And you keep repeating that process of breaking something down into smaller tasks until you reach a point where you don’t need to tell the computer what to do anymore – it already knows how to do that task.
        
        The essence of programming is the process of problem solving, complex thinking, attention to detail, and reasoning – all using a computer.
        
        Programming involves thinking of all the different steps a user could take and considering all the different things that could go wrong. Once you've thought of all potential problems a user may encounter you have to find solutions before you code anything.
        
        We can think of problem solving as taking an input (the information and details about our problem that we want to solve) and generating an output (the end goal or the solution to our problem).
        
        Outputs can be complicated and millions can run per second.</P>
    <H3>DIFFERENT PROGRAMMING LANFUAGE: HTML, JAVA, PYTHON, CSS, ETC</H3>
    <P><B>HTML-</B>HTML, or hypertext markup language, is the standard way of coding web pages to showcase electronic information. Founded by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML helps to format content, pictures, and videos featured online. HTML tells the internet browser how to display websites for an optimal user experience </P>
    <p><B>JAVA-</B>Java is an object-oriented coding language created by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Java has English-based commands used to create applications for a single computer or whole server and tiny applets for websites. Java is a popular favorite for programming mobile apps and video games, such as on Android operating systems.</p>
    <p> <B>PYTHON-</B>Python is a server-side web and software development language started by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Python has a simple, English-like syntax to script back-end actions for applications, user interfaces, and operating systems. Many platforms, including Google, use Python. It is a popular programming language.</p>
    <p> <B>CSS-</B>CSS, or cascading style sheets, is a coding language used to specify a website’s style. Developed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994, CSS informs internet browsers about a page’s layout, background color, font size, cursor shape, and more. Crafting and maintaining solid CSS code is crucial for websites to have aesthetic appeal.</P>
